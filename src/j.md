Trying J again. Reading book _J for C Programmers_ by Henry Rich, 2007.
This book already in my J folder. I don't remember where I got it.
Maybe from J wiki.

After reading some chapters, this book remind me that what makes you
don't like something is because you learn it from wrong resource.
So I dropped this book.
