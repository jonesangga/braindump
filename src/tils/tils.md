# TIL

Below are short and trivial things that I just learned. For a slighly longer
see sub chapters.

- There is Number.EPSILON in javascript which equals 2.220446049250313e-16.
  It should not be used for checking equality with error like `abs(a-b) < Number.EPSILON`.

- `g<Tab>` go to the last accessed tab in vim.

- Setting `position: absolute` to html tag will make `pre` element selected when clicking empty region.
