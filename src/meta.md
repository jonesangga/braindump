Before you read all these notes, these might help:

1. I can read English well but I am not good at writing English.
1. I don't check my grammar when writing because it will distract me.
1. I mainly write about CS, programming language, and mathematics
   but I only have degree in mathematics (undergraduate).
1. Everything can change drastically. You might want to see the commit history
   (though, my commit messages are just "update").

I should make some rules and style guides to follow when writing this.
These will change as I write more and find suitable style for me:

1. Always write the date before an important update or paragraph.
1. Write to [uncategorized](./uncategorized.md) all links I just found and didn't have time to check.
