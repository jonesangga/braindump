Before you read all these notes, these might help:

1. I can read English well but I am not good at writing English.
1. I don't check my grammar when writing because it will distract me.
1. I mainly write about CS, programming language, and mathematics
   but I only have degree in mathematics (undergraduate).
1. Everything can change drastically. In any case you might want to refer to the commit history.

I should make some rules and style guides to follow when writing this.
These will change as I write more and find suitable style for me:

1. Always write the date before an important update or paragraph.
1. Use **do**: x as todo.
1. Use **read**: y as to be read.

## TODO

- Add review pages for books (and maybe anime, manga, music).
